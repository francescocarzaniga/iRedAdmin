        - Not add ldap attribute/value pairs required by Dovecot-2.3:

= 0.8 =
    * Improvements:
        + Able to generate and verify SHA512 password hash.

    * Fixed issues:
        - tools/upgrade_iredadmin.sh:
            - Not able to upgrade SQL database if we're using a remote MySQL
              server. Fixed by introducing two new command line arguments:
                * SQL_IREDADMIN_USER: specify the sql username.
                * MY_CNF: specify alternative file of /root/.my.cnf.
            - Not copy custom config file 'custom_settings.py' - it's used in
              iRedMail cluster solution.
        - Not correctly query all managed domains.
        - Missing two '%s' for string format.

= 0.7 =
    * Improvements:
        + Able to specify sql table name which is used to store real-time
          mailbox quota usage. Defaults to 'used_quota'.
        + Fix improper links in admin log page.
        + New: tools/update_password_with_csv.py, used to reset password by
          reading password from CSV file (format: '<email> <password>').

= 0.6.3 =

    * Fixed issues:
        - SECURITY: iRedAdmin accepts any password on FreeBSD and OpenBSD
          if password is stored in BCRYPT hash.
        - SQL backends: Cannot identify separately created global admins.
        - OpenBSD ldapd(*) cannot handle MOD_DELETE correctly, it will
          remove all values of this attribute instead of removing just the
          one we specified.

          As a workaround, we define ldap server name in parameter
          'LDAP_SERVER_NAME'. For ldapd, perform one extra LDAP query to get
          all present values of the attribute first, then remove the one we
          want to delete.

    * Fixed issues:

          backend.

= 0.4 =
    * Improvements:
        + Able to generate 'CRAM-MD5' password hash with command `doveadm pw`.
        + Able to generate bcrypt password hash with Python module 'bcrypt' or
          'py-bcrypt'.
          NOTE: It works on BSD systems, but not Linux. Since libc shpped in
                most Linux distributions doesn't bcrypt, Dovecot cannot verify
                bcrypt hash on Linux.

        - Incorrect regular expression which not support IDN domain name.
        - Incorrect link in sub-navication bar in account profile page.
        - Missing LDAP attribute/value pairs required by Dovecot:
            o enabledService=indexer-worker.
            o enabledService=dsync

= 0.3.3 =
    * Fixed issues:

          Note: SSHA512 requires Dovecot-2.0 (and later), Python-2.5 (or
          later).

    * Fixed:
        - Incorrectly unset domainGlobalAdmin status in session after updating
          admin profile.
